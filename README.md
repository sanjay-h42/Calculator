The Real Calculator is a user‑friendly Java application built with a straightforward Swing‑based GUI (Graphical User Interface). It animates the core calculator experience with a clean layout: a display area and buttons for digits, decimal points, and basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
